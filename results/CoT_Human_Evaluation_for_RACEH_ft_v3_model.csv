"While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: Some powerful works of literature have so influenced readers that new legislation has been passed as a result.

Equiano’s book contributed to the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807. The Jungle (1906) is a fictional work by Upton Sinclair that describes unsanitary conditions in US meatpacking plants.
