"The following text is adapted from Paul Laurence Dunbar’s 1902 novel The Sport of the Gods. Joe and some of his family members have recently moved to New York City. [Joe] was wild with enthusiasm and with a desire to be a part of all that the metropolis meant. In the evening he saw the young fellows passing by dressed in their spruce clothes, and he wondered with a sort of envy where they could be going. Back home there had been no place much worth going to, except church and one or two people’s houses.",Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?,It illustrates a character’s reaction to a new environment.,It explains why a character has traveled to a city.,It compares a character’s thoughts about an event at two different times of day.,It presents a character feeling regret over leaving home.,A,"Choice A is the best answer because it accurately captures the text’s main purpose. The text highlights Joe’s enthusiasm and curiosity about New York City, noting his observations of well-dressed young men and contrasting this with the limited social options back home. This shows the text’s focus on illustrating Joe’s reaction to his new urban environment, not his reasons for moving, thoughts at different times, or regret about leaving home.","A: provides a good answer to a question about a passage because it exhibits both an aspect of the question and an answer that exhibits the main point of the passage.

And over her face she draws a veil As shimmering fine as floating dew ... And here and there In the black of her hair The subtle hands of Night Move slowly with their gem-starred light.""",Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?,It presents alternating descriptions of night in a rural area and in a city.,"It sketches an image of nightfall, then an image of sunrise.",It makes an extended comparison of night to a human being.,It portrays how night changes from one season of the year to the next.,C,"Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall
 structure of the text. Throughout the text, the speaker characterizes nighttime as
 if it were a person who wears clothing (“a garment” that is “velvet soft” and “violet
 blue”) and a veil “over her face” and who moves her hands “slowly with their
 gem-starred light” through her dark hair. Thus, the text is structured as an
 extended comparison of night to a human being.","A: provides a good structure for the question, because it exhibits a sequence of steps that step through the structure of a question and answer.

"While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes: Some powerful works of literature have so influenced readers that new legislation has been passed as a result. The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano (1789) is the autobiography of a man who endured slavery on both sides of the Atlantic. Equiano’s book contributed to the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807. The Jungle (1906) is a fictional work by Upton Sinclair that describes unsanitary conditions in US meatpacking plants. Sinclair’s book contributed to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906.",The student wants to emphasize a difference between the two books. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?,"Although both are powerful works of literature that contributed to new legislation, Equiano’s book is an autobiography, while Sinclair’s is fictional.","They may have written about different topics, but Equiano and Sinclair both influenced readers.","The 1807 Slave Trade Act resulted in part from a book by Equiano, while the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act resulted in part from a book by Sinclair.","The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano and The Jungle are two works of literature that contributed to new legislation (concerning the slave trade and food safety, respectively).",B,"Choice B is the best answer because it effectively emphasizes a difference between Equiano’s The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano and Sinclair’s The Jungle by noting they “written about different topics”—slavery versus unsanitary meatpacking conditions—as per the notes. This directly highlights a key distinction in their subject matter, aligning with the student’s goal.","A: because the two examples show how a single work of literature—an autobiography, a fictional narrative, or a dramatic work—can have a significant impact on legislation, an essay or question about a specific piece of literature can benefit from an examination of how that work has influenced legislation.

For her album Orchestral Powwow, Derksen composed new songs in the style of traditional powwow music that were accompanied by classical arrangements played by an orchestra.

The text describes how Cris Derksen combines Indigenous powwow music with classical arrangements in her album Orchestral Powwow, highlighting her use of a powwow drum to lead the orchestra. This illustrates her blending of Indigenous and classical musical traditions to reflect Canada’s diverse cultural landscape.","Choice A: highlights a difference in the two pieces because the orchestral arrangement is accompanied by a rhythmic pattern that would normally be directed by a conductor.

C: The addition of a drumbeat in the arrangement helps to draw the attention of the audience to the piece“s distinctive rhythmic patterns, which would otherwise be lost in a more traditional arrangement.’

 discussion of painter Alma W. Thomas’s work. In this context, “influenced” means
 to have had an effect on something’s development. The text indicates that there
 is a connection between Thomas’s work and the flowers and trees in her home’s
