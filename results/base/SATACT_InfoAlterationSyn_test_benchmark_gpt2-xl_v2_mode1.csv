You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter—brain chemical—as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of ""ma,"" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. ""Ma"" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb—not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold—to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience—all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler—sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development—and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their ""startle"" and ""rooting"" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.",The main point of this passage is to:,illustrate the importance of genetics in the formation of a baby's brain.,illustrate the importance of stimulation and experience in the formation of a baby's brain.,indicate the great need for conducting further research on babies' brains.,compare the latest research on babies' brains with similar research conducted fifteen years ago.,B

You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter—brain chemical—as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of ""ma,"" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. ""Ma"" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb—not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold—to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience—all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler—sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development—and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their ""startle"" and ""rooting"" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.","The main point made in the second, third, and fourth paragraphs is that the structure of a baby's brain:",is genetically determined before the child is born.,can be seen through positron-emission tomography.,can be altered through a process known as pruning.,is still developing after the child is born.,D

For a woman to concede this is not disloyal to her sex; it's the first step in the creation of an environment in which women artists will flourish. But what can be done about the fact that the list of beloved women poets is not as long as the list of beloved poets who were born male? Paragraph 2: The most liberating response to the problem was the one Elizabeth Bishop chose. As James Merrill writes, ""Lowell called her one of the four best womenpoets ever—which can hardly have pleased Miss Bishop, who kept her work from appearing in 'women's anthologies.' Better, from her point of view, to be one of the forty, or forty thousand, best poets, and have done with it."" And he adds, ""If I raise the issue at all, it's to dissociate her from these shopworn polarities."" For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another ""sister"" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: ""You are a great poet—and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,"" her letter went. ""When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy."" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary ""canon,"" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism—""to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought""—and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws—William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams—and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears. Paragraph 8: The problem with taking men poets down a peg, however, is that it's hard to do so with discernment. The zeal to undo, immediately, the centuries of neglect and abuse endured by women poets has resulted in the devaluation of great poets who were born male and (farworse) in the devaluation of poetry itself.","It may reasonably be inferred that the author considers Emily Dickinson ""one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived"" in part because:",her writing was discovered in such a dramatic way by her editor.,"she lived such a romantic life, dressing in white and enjoying many suitors.",she was never interrupted by her disciples.,"she lived in isolation, which allowed her much time to write.",D

You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter—brain chemical—as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of ""ma,"" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. ""Ma"" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb—not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold—to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience—all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler—sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development—and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their ""startle"" and ""rooting"" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.","According to the passage, one thing PET allows neurobiologists to do is:",observe activity in the frontal cortex of a baby's brain.,determine the number of genes involved in the formation of a baby's brain.,control the release of neurotransmitters in a baby's auditory cortex.,restore microscopic connections in a baby's brain.,A

My father was an avid gardener, he still is: and every Saturday morning he would put on his work clothes, pick up his hoe and trowel, and would head out the back door. 3 Paragraph 2: [2] As a ten-year-old, I was supremely unenthusiastic about swinging a hoe in the garden when I could be out playing with my friends. Having tried and failed,my father was unable to make a gardener of me. I had no qualms, of course, about enjoying the results of his labor: the potatoes, squash, cucumbers, and cauliflower that he pursued out of the earth. I would even help him dig out the potatoes or cut a cucumber from its vine. To me, it was much more fun to reap than sowing. Paragraph 3: [3] Many years later, living in an upstairs apartment, I am more often sorry I didn't follow my father out to the garden. I have several indoor plants, but the experience is not the same. The few times that I've helped a friend with yard work has given me the joy of touching the soil with an open palm, to get the earth under my fingernails, of patting down the berm around a newly transplanted sapling. Now that I live far from my father (I live in Iowa on the other side of the world), I wish I'd spend more time with him in the garden. Paragraph 4: [4]My favorite photograph of my father shows him squatting on his heels, trowel in hand, behind a golden heap of onions freshly pulled from the ground. His glowing smile are evidence of his pride in the onions—the proof of his labor and love—and in me, the photographer, his son. In that photo, his love of the land and his love for me are somehow intertwined, indivisible. It is that same love—love of kin, love of land—that pushes under my fingernails, pushes against my skin, when I thrust my hand into the yielding earth and think that on its far side my father might be doing the same.","At point [4], the writer is considering adding the following true statement: ""I have many photo albums, and each one includes pictures of my father in various poses.""

For a woman to concede this is not disloyal to her sex; it's the first step in the creation of an environment in which women artists will flourish. But what can be done about the fact that the list of beloved women poets is not as long as the list of beloved poets who were born male? Paragraph 2: The most liberating response to the problem was the one Elizabeth Bishop chose. As James Merrill writes, ""Lowell called her one of the four best womenpoets ever—which can hardly have pleased Miss Bishop, who kept her work from appearing in 'women's anthologies.' Better, from her point of view, to be one of the forty, or forty thousand, best poets, and have done with it."" And he adds, ""If I raise the issue at all, it's to dissociate her from these shopworn polarities."" For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another ""sister"" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: ""You are a great poet—and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,"" her letter went. ""When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy."" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary ""canon,"" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism—""to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought""—and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws—William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams—and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears. Paragraph 8: The problem with taking men poets down a peg, however, is that it's hard to do so with discernment. The zeal to undo, immediately, the centuries of neglect and abuse endured by women poets has resulted in the devaluation of great poets who were born male and (farworse) in the devaluation of poetry itself.","The last paragraph suggests that those who would reevaluate, and perhaps want to devalue, the work of famous male poets should above all be:",cautious.,decisive.,opinionated.,zealous.,A

For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another ""sister"" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: ""You are a great poet—and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,"" her letter went. ""When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy."" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary ""canon,"" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism—""to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought""—and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws—William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams—and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears. Paragraph 8: The problem with taking men poets down a peg, however, is that it's hard to do so with discernment. The zeal to undo, immediately, the centuries of neglect and abuse endured by women poets has resulted in the devaluation of great poets who were born male and (farworse) in the devaluation of poetry itself.","Which of the following most nearly paraphrases Helen Hunt Jackson's statement to Emily Dickinson that ""it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud""?",It is morally reprehensible of you not to let other poets read your work.,It is unacceptable for you to continue writing; you should become a singer.,It is stingy and wrong of you not to read out loud to those who like your work.,It is unfair to this age that you do not share your poetry with the world.,D
A,True,4498.3466796875,4555.0625,4769.3203125,4850.26416015625,"How to Build a Baby's Brain: Paragraph 1: You cannot see what is going on inside your new-born's brain. You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter—brain chemical—as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of ""ma,"" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. ""Ma"" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb—not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold—to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience—all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler—sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development—and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their ""startle"" and ""rooting"" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.",The last paragraph suggests that the formation of synapses occurs most rapidly:,during the first two months of a child's life.,during the first nine months of a child's life.,from the time a child is about six months old until that child is about ten years old.,from the time a child is about one year old until that child is well into adolescence.,C

The pipes, which can vary numerously from three to fifteen, are fashioned from clay that is rolled around a mold. Each pipe is individually rolled to create the proper pitch before being bound to the other pipes. Paragraph 3: The antara dates back to the ninth century. Evidence about how musicians played the instrument have come from painted images on Incan ceramic pottery. Musicians are depicted playing a six-pipe antara by holding the lower ends of the two longer pipes with the right hand while placing the left hand near the remaining tops of the four pipes. The antara was also sometimes held in one hand while the other hand beat a cylindrical drum. Paragraph 4: [1] Due to the limited number of notes that can be played on an antara, early musicians' most likely worked in groups, coordinating the timing and pitch of their instruments to extend the range of sounds produced. [2] Other pottery images show two antara players facing each other while dancing. [3] Each player holds a set of pipes so that both sets are connected to the other set by a string, as if to suggest that those two antaras should be played together. [4] Even to this day, descendants of the Incas, the Quechua people of Peru and Bolivia, prefer to play matched antaras bound together. Paragraph 5: Unfortunately, the music of the Incas can probably never be exactly re-creating. Yet one can hear in the music of their descendants, beautiful variations on a musical sound that has survived for many centuries.","In the sentence ""Each player holds a set of pipes so that both sets are connected to the other set by a string, as if to suggest that those two antaras should be played together."", what is the best answer to replace the phrase ""so that both sets are""?",NO CHANGE,in such a way that both sets are,with both sets being,OMIT the underlined portion.,D
