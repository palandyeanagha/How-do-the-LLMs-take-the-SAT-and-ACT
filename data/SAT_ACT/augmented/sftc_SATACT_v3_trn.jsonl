{"context": "[[HL]] Personality [[/HL]] [[HL]] Disorders [[/HL]] : [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] [[HL]] 1 [[/HL]] : How should the [[HL]] law [[/HL]] treat a [[HL]] mentally [[/HL]] [[HL]] disturbed [[/HL]] [[HL]] person [[/HL]] who [[HL]] commits [[/HL]] a [[HL]] criminal [[/HL]] [[HL]] offense [[/HL]] ? Should individuals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions ? These questions are of concern to social scientists , to members of the legal profession , and to individuals who work with [[HL]] criminal [[/HL]] offenders . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 2 : Over the centuries , an important part of Western [[HL]] law [[/HL]] has been the concept that a civilized society should not punish a [[HL]] person [[/HL]] who is [[HL]] mentally [[/HL]] incapable of controlling his or her conduct . In 1724 , an English court maintained that a man [[HL]] was [[/HL]] not responsible for an act if \" he doth not know what he is doing , no more than . . . [[HL]] awild [[/HL]] beast . \" Modern standards of legal responsibility , however , have been based on the McNaghten decision of 1843 . McNaghten , a Scotsman , suffered the paranoid delusion that he [[HL]] was [[/HL]] being persecuted by the English prime minister , Sir Robert Peel . In an attempt to kill Peel , he mistakenly shot Peel 's secretary . Everyone involved in the trial [[HL]] was [[/HL]] [[HL]] convinced [[/HL]] by McNaghten 's senseless ramblings that he [[HL]] was [[/HL]] insane . He [[HL]] was [[/HL]] judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital , where he remained until his death . But Queen Victoria [[HL]] was [[/HL]] not pleased with the verdict \u2014 apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly \u2014 and called on the House of Lords to review the decision . The decision [[HL]] was [[/HL]] upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing . The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \" not guilty by reason of insanity \" only if he were so severely [[HL]] disturbed [[/HL]] at the time of his act that he did not know what he [[HL]] was [[/HL]] doing , or that if he did know what he [[HL]] was [[/HL]] doing , he did not know it [[HL]] was [[/HL]] wrong . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 3 : The McNaghten Rule [[HL]] was [[/HL]] adopted in the United States , and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century . Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \" irresistible impulse , \" which recognizes that some [[HL]] mentally [[/HL]] ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 4 : During the 1970s , a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity proposed by the American [[HL]] Law [[/HL]] Institute , which states : \" A [[HL]] person [[/HL]] is not responsible for [[HL]] criminal [[/HL]] conduct if at the time of such conduct , as a result of mental disease or defect , he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the [[HL]] law [[/HL]] . \" The word substantial suggests that \" any \" incapacity is not enough to avoid [[HL]] criminal [[/HL]] responsibility but that \" total \" incapacityis not required either . The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough ; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or legal consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 5 : The problem of legal responsibility in the case of [[HL]] mentally [[/HL]] disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate , and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense . The reasons for this recommendation are varied . Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures \u2014 in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant 's mental state \u2014 are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice . Some also argue that the abuse of the insanity plea by [[HL]] clever [[/HL]] lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction . Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment ( an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a [[HL]] person [[/HL]] for life ) than being convicted and sent to prison ( with the possibility of parole in a few years ) . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 6 : Despite the current controversy , actual cases of acquittal by reason of insanity are quite rare . Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally responsible for their acts , and lawyers , knowing that an insanity plea is apt to fail , tend to use it only as a last resort . In California in 1980 , only 259 defendants ( outof approximately 52,000 ) were successful in pleading not guilty by reason of insanity .", "question": "awild _ .

Paragraph 2 : Somehow we [[HL]] 're [[/HL]] going to see it . We 'll see Armstrong in his space suit emerge from the metal door ; we 'll see it as if looking through a scratched and dirty window , with blips and bleeps and static and a shimmering gray overlaying everything because he 's out there now , a lone man in a different atmosphere altogether , moving backward down the ladder one slow step at a time . And then , right before his foot touches down in the dust , the words that will become an emblem : one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind . He does it , takes a little hop down onto that alien surface , the only man in the universe . Paragraph 3 : Everyone is sitting quiet , watching , forks in midair \u2014 I can see the profile of my father 's jaw , my mother 's small shoulders \u2014 and just at that moment , I decide to clank my fork on the edge of my plate , to make a loud noise that will penetrate the vast silence in which this man now moves . Everyone turns toward me : father , mother , brothers , angry , annoyed , and my father says well , thank you very much , and I know I 've ruined it , this historic moment . Paragraph 4 : I do n't know why I did it : maybe I just feel vastly lonely , want to make my presence known , or maybe Ithought it would be funny , or maybe I was kind of applauding , the way the men in Houston must have been jumping up and down , shaking hands , mission accomplished after so many years of study and work and planning , they had done it , they had put a man onthe moon ! My faux - pas just hangs in the air , the clank of the fork still hurting my ears . They turn back to the television , the set of their bodies so solidly against me , and I guess I do n't really understand why it would be so great \u2014 to be a man on the moon , exiled , in orbit so far from home .

{"context": "Personality Disorders : Paragraph 1 : How should the law treat a mentally disturbed [[HL]] person [[/HL]] who commits a criminal offense ? Should individuals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions ? These questions are of concern to social scientists , to members of the [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] profession , and to individuals who work with criminal offenders . Paragraph 2 : Over the centuries , an important part of Western law has [[HL]] been [[/HL]] the concept that a civilized society should not punish a [[HL]] person [[/HL]] who is mentally incapable of controlling his or her conduct . In 1724 , an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \" he doth not know what he is doing , no more than . . . awild beast . \" Modern standards of [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] responsibility , [[HL]] however [[/HL]] , [[HL]] have [[/HL]] [[HL]] been [[/HL]] [[HL]] based [[/HL]] on the McNaghten decision of 1843 . McNaghten , a Scotsman , suffered the paranoid delusion that he was [[HL]] being [[/HL]] persecuted by the English prime minister , Sir Robert Peel . In an attempt to kill Peel , he mistakenly shot Peel 's secretary . Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten 's senseless ramblings that he was insane . He was judged not responsible by reason of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] and sent to a mental hospital , where he remained until his death . But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict \u2014 apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly \u2014 and called on the House of Lords to review the decision . The decision was upheld and rules for the [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] definition of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] were put into writing . The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \" not guilty by reason of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] \" [[HL]] only [[/HL]] if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing , or that if he did know what he was doing , he did not know it was wrong . Paragraph 3 : The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States , and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] for over a century .

Father , mother , brothers \u2014 we're all angled toward the television because something momentous is about to happen : the first [[HL]] man [[/HL]] to walk on the moon .

Everyone turns toward me : father , mother , brothers , angry , annoyed , and my father says well , thank you very much , and I know I 've ruined it , this historic moment . Paragraph 4 : I do n't know why I did it : maybe I just feel vastly lonely , want to make my presence known , or maybe Ithought it would be funny , or maybe I was kind of applauding , the way the men in Houston must have been jumping up and down , shaking hands , mission accomplished after so many years of study and work and planning , they had done it , they had put a [[HL]] man [[/HL]] onthe moon ! My faux - pas just hangs in the air , the clank of the fork still hurting my ears .

{"context": "How to Build a Baby 's [[HL]] Brain [[/HL]] : [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 1 : You can not see what is going on inside your new - born 's [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] . You can not see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and , almost instantaneously , a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] 's visual [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] that will last all her life . The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind . And you can not see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter \u2014 [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] chemical \u2014 as a neuron from your baby 's ear , carrying the electrically encoded sound of \" ma , \" connects to a neuron in her auditory [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] . \" Ma \" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant 's [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] that will , as long as the child lives , respond to no other sound . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 2 : You can not see any of this . But Dr. Harry [[HL]] Chugani [[/HL]] can come close . With positron - emission tomography ( PET ) , [[HL]] Chugani [[/HL]] , a pediatric neurobiologist , watches the regions of a baby 's [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] turn on , one after another , like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout . He can measure activity in the primitive [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] stem and sensory [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] from the moment the baby is born . He can observe the visual [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] burn with activity in the second and third months of life . He can see the frontal [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] light up at 6 to 8 months . He can see , in other words , that the [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb \u2014 not merely growing bigger , but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling , learning and remembering . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 3 : Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after [[HL]] birth [[/HL]] , rather than something innate , determine the actual wiring of the human [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] . Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time [[HL]] babies [[/HL]] are born , the structure of their brains had been genetically determined . But by 1996 , researchers knew that was wrong . Instead , early - childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact , physically determining how the intricate neural [[HL]] circuits [[/HL]] of the [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] are wired . Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] 's [[HL]] circuits [[/HL]] . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 4 : At [[HL]] birth [[/HL]] , the [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] 's 100 billion or so neurons [[HL]] form [[/HL]] more than 50 trillion connections ( [[HL]] synapses [[/HL]] ) . The genes the baby carries have already determined his [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] 's basic wiring . They have formed the connections in the [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire . But that 's not all . Of a human 's 80,000 [[HL]] different [[/HL]] genes , fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system . Yet even that does n't come close to what the [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] needs . In the first months of life , the number of [[HL]] synapses [[/HL]] will increase 20 - 50 fold \u2014 to more than 1,000 trillion . There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 5 : That leaves experience \u2014 all the signals that a baby receives from the world . Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening [[HL]] synapses [[/HL]] . Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time , so [[HL]] synapses [[/HL]] that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning . The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation . Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents , stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards . Rather , it is something [[HL]] much [[/HL]] simpler \u2014 sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale . In the most extensive study [[HL]] yet [[/HL]] of what makes a difference , Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks , beads , peekaboo and other old - fashioned measures that enhance cognitive , motor and language development \u2014 and , absent traumas , enhance them permanently . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 6 : The formation of [[HL]] synapses [[/HL]] ( synaptogenesis ) and their pruning occurs at [[HL]] different [[/HL]] [[HL]] times [[/HL]] in [[HL]] different [[/HL]] parts of the [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] . The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills . Synaptogenesis begins in the motor [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] at about 2 months . Around then , infants lose their \" startle \" and \" rooting \" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements . At 3 months , synapse formation in the visual [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] peaks ; the brainis fine - tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object . At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus , which indexes and files memories , becomes fully functional ; only now can [[HL]] babies [[/HL]] [[HL]] form [[/HL]] [[HL]] explicit [[/HL]] memories of , say , how to move a mobile . In the second half of the first year , [[HL]] finds [[/HL]] [[HL]] Chugani [[/HL]] , the [[HL]] prefrontal [[/HL]] [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] , the [[HL]] seat [[/HL]] of forethought and logic , [[HL]] forms [[/HL]] [[HL]] synapses [[/HL]] at such a [[HL]] rate [[/HL]] that it [[HL]] consumes [[/HL]] [[HL]] twice [[/HL]] as [[HL]] much [[/HL]] [[HL]] energy [[/HL]] as an [[HL]] adult [[/HL]] [[HL]] brain [[/HL]] .

{"context": "Personality Disorders : [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 1 : How should the law treat a [[HL]] mentally [[/HL]] disturbed person who commits a criminal offense ? Should [[HL]] individuals [[/HL]] whose [[HL]] mental [[/HL]] faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions ? These questions are of concern to social scientists , to members of the [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] profession , and to [[HL]] individuals [[/HL]] who work with criminal offenders . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 2 : Over the centuries , an important part of Western law has been the concept that a civilized society should not punish a person who is [[HL]] mentally [[/HL]] incapable of controlling his or her conduct . In 1724 , an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \" he doth not know what he is doing , no more than . . . awild beast . \" Modern standards of [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] [[HL]] responsibility [[/HL]] , however , have been based on the McNaghten decision of 1843 . McNaghten , a Scotsman , suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister , Sir Robert Peel . In an attempt to kill Peel , he mistakenly shot Peel 's secretary . Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten 's senseless ramblings that he was insane . He was judged not responsible by reason of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] and sent to a [[HL]] mental [[/HL]] hospital , where he remained until his death . But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict \u2014 apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly \u2014 and called on the House of Lords to review the decision . The decision was upheld and rules for the [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] definition of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] were put into writing . The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \" not guilty by reason of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] \" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing , or that if he did know what he was doing , he did not know it was wrong . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 3 : The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States , and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] for over a century . Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \" irresistible impulse , \" which recognizes that some [[HL]] mentally [[/HL]] ill [[HL]] individuals [[/HL]] may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 4 : During the 1970s , a [[HL]] number [[/HL]] of state and federal courts adopted a broader [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] definition of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] proposed by the American Law Institute , which states : \" A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct , as a result of [[HL]] mental [[/HL]] disease or defect , he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law . \" The word substantial suggests that \" any \" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal [[HL]] responsibility [[/HL]] but that \" total \" incapacityis not required either . The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough ; [[HL]] individuals [[/HL]] must have some understanding of the moral or [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] [[HL]] 5 [[/HL]] : The [[HL]] problem [[/HL]] of [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] [[HL]] responsibility [[/HL]] in the [[HL]] case [[/HL]] of [[HL]] mentally [[/HL]] [[HL]] disordered [[/HL]] [[HL]] individuals [[/HL]] is [[HL]] currently [[/HL]] a [[HL]] topic [[/HL]] of [[HL]] intense [[/HL]] [[HL]] debate [[/HL]] , and a [[HL]] number [[/HL]] of [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] and [[HL]] mental [[/HL]] [[HL]] health [[/HL]] [[HL]] professionals [[/HL]] have [[HL]] recommended [[/HL]] [[HL]] abolishing [[/HL]] the [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] [[HL]] plea [[/HL]] as a [[HL]] defense [[/HL]] . The reasons for this recommendation are varied . Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures \u2014 in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the [[HL]] defense [[/HL]] present contradictory evidence as to the defendant 's [[HL]] mental [[/HL]] state \u2014 are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice . Some also argue that the abuse of the [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] [[HL]] plea [[/HL]] by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction . Others claim that acquittal by reason of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] often leads to a worse punishment ( an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life ) than being convicted and sent to prison ( with the possibility of parole in a few years ) .

As head of the community center he went after every existing grant on the city and state level to bring them puppet shows with the message to avoid drugs and stay in school ; and plays in the park such as actors rapping their way through Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream . Abshu believed there was something in Shakespeare for everyone , even the young of Brewster Place , and if he broadened their horizons just a little bit , there might be enough room for some of them to slip through and see what the world had waiting . No , it would not be a perfect world , but definitely one with more room than they had now . Paragraph 2 : The kids who hung around the community center liked Abshu , because he never preached and it was clear that when they spoke he listened ; so he could zero in on the kid who had a real problem .

[[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 2 : The kids who hung around the community center liked [[HL]] Abshu [[/HL]] , because he never preached and it was clear that when they spoke he listened ; so he could zero in on the kid who had a real problem . It might be an offhand remark while shooting a game of pool or a one - on - one out on the basketball court , but he had a way of making them feel special with just a word or two . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 3 : [[HL]] Abshu [[/HL]] wished that his own family could have stayed together . There were four of them who ended up in [[HL]] foster [[/HL]] [[HL]] care [[/HL]] : him , two younger sisters , and a baby brother . He understood why his mother did what she did , but he could n't help wondering if there might have been a better way . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] [[HL]] 4 [[/HL]] : [[HL]] Abshu [[/HL]] was put into a home that already had two other boys from [[HL]] foster [[/HL]] [[HL]] care [[/HL]] . The Masons lived in a small wooden bungalow [[HL]] right [[/HL]] on the [[HL]] edge [[/HL]] of Linden Hills . And Mother Mason insisted that they tell anybody who asked that they actually lived in Linden Hills , a more prestigious address than Summit Place . It was a home that was kept immaculate . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 5 : But what he [[HL]] remembered [[/HL]] [[HL]] most [[/HL]] about the Masons was that it seemed there was never quite enough to eat . She sent them to school with a lunch of exactly one and a half sandwiches \u2014 white bread spread with margarine and sprinkled with sugar \u2014 and half an apple . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 6 : When [[HL]] Abshu [[/HL]] dreamed of leaving \u2014 which was every day \u2014 he had his own apartment with a refrigerator overflowing with food that he gorged himself with day and night . The Masons were n't mean people ; he knew he could have ended up with a lot worse . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 7 : [[HL]] Abshu [[/HL]] lived with these people for nine years , won a scholarship to the local college , and moved out to support himself through school by working in a doughnut shop . By this time his mother was ready to take her children back home , but he decided that since he was already out on his own he would stay there . One less mouth for her to worry about feeding . And after he graduated with his degree in social work , he might even be able to give her a little money to help her along . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 8 : One thing he did thank the Masons for was keeping him out of gangs . There was a strict curfew in their home that was rigidly observed . And church was mandatory . \" When you 're out on your own , \" Father Mason always said , \" you can do whatever you want , but in my home you do as I say . \" No , they were n't mean people , but they were stingy \u2014 stingy with their food and with their affection . Existing that way all the time , on the [[HL]] edge [[/HL]] of hunger , on the [[HL]] edge [[/HL]] of kindness , gave [[HL]] Abshu [[/HL]] an appreciation for a life fully lived . Do whatever job makes you happy , regardless of the cost ; and fill your home with love . Well , his home became the community center [[HL]] right [[/HL]] around the corner from Brewster Place and the job that made him [[HL]] most [[/HL]] fulfilled was working with young kids . [[HL]] Paragraph [[/HL]] 9 : The kids who hung out at the community center were n't all lost yet . They wanted to make [[HL]] use [[/HL]] of the tutors for their homework ; and they wanted a safe place to hang . His [[HL]] motto [[/HL]] was : [[HL]] Lose [[/HL]] no [[HL]] child [[/HL]] to the [[HL]] streets [[/HL]] . And on occasion when that happened , he went home to cry . But he never let his emotions show at work . To the kids he was just a big , quiet kind of dude who did n't go looking for trouble , but he would n't run from it either . He was always challenged by a new set of boys who showed up at the center . He made it real clear to them that this was his territory \u2014 his rules \u2014 and if they needed to flex their muscles , they were welcome to try . And he showed many that just because he was kind , it did n't mean he was weak . There had to be rules some - in their world , some kind of discipline . And if they understood that , then he worked with them , long and hard , to let them see that they could make a difference in their own lives .", "question": "Paragraph 4 : Abshu _ into a _ _ from foster care .

Having tried and failed , my father was unable to make a gardener of me . I [[HL]] had [[/HL]] no qualms , of course , about enjoying the results of his labor : the [[HL]] potatoes [[/HL]] , squash , cucumbers , and cauliflower that he pursued out of the earth .

I have several indoor plants , but the experience is not the same . The few times that I 've helped a friend with yard work has given me the joy of touching the soil with an open palm , to get the earth under my fingernails , of patting down the berm around a newly transplanted sapling .

{"context": "How to Build a Baby 's Brain : Paragraph 1 : You can not see what is going on inside your new - born 's brain . You can not see the electrical [[HL]] activity [[/HL]] as her eyes lock onto yours and , almost instantaneously , a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain 's [[HL]] visual [[/HL]] [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] that will last all her [[HL]] life [[/HL]] . The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind . And you can not see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter \u2014 brain chemical \u2014 as a neuron from your baby 's ear , carrying the electrically encoded sound of \" ma , \" connects to a neuron in her auditory [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] . \" Ma \" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant 's brain that will , as long as the child lives , respond to no other sound . Paragraph 2 : You can not see any of this . But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close . With positron - emission tomography ( PET ) , Chugani , a pediatric neurobiologist , watches the regions of a baby 's brain turn on , one after another , like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout . He can measure [[HL]] activity [[/HL]] in the primitive brain stem and sensory [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] from the moment the baby is born . He can [[HL]] observe [[/HL]] the [[HL]] visual [[/HL]] [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] [[HL]] burn [[/HL]] with [[HL]] activity [[/HL]] in the [[HL]] second [[/HL]] and [[HL]] third [[/HL]] [[HL]] months [[/HL]] of [[HL]] life [[/HL]] . He can see the frontal [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] light up at 6 to 8 [[HL]] months [[/HL]] . He can see , in other words , that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb \u2014 not merely growing bigger , but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling , learning and remembering . Paragraph 3 : Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth , rather than something innate , determine the actual wiring of the human brain . Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born , the structure of their brains had been genetically determined . But by 1996 , researchers knew that was wrong . Instead , early - childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact , physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired . Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain 's circuits . Paragraph 4 : At birth , the brain 's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections ( synapses ) . The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain 's basic wiring . They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire . But that 's not all . Of a human 's 80,000 different genes , fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system . Yet even that does n't come close to what the brain needs . In the first [[HL]] months [[/HL]] of [[HL]] life [[/HL]] , the number of synapses will increase 20 - 50 fold \u2014 to more than 1,000 trillion . There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections . Paragraph 5 : That leaves experience \u2014 all the signals that a baby receives from the world . Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses . Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time , so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning . The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation . Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents , stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards . Rather , it is something much simpler \u2014 sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale . In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference , Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks , beads , peekaboo and other old - fashioned measures that enhance cognitive , motor and language development \u2014 and , absent traumas , enhance them permanently . Paragraph 6 : The formation of synapses ( synaptogenesis ) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain . The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills . Synaptogenesis begins in the motor [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] at about 2 [[HL]] months [[/HL]] . Around then , infants lose their \" startle \" and \" rooting \" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements . At 3 [[HL]] months [[/HL]] , synapse formation in the [[HL]] visual [[/HL]] [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] peaks ; the brainis fine - tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object . At 8 or 9 [[HL]] months [[/HL]] the hippocampus , which indexes and files memories , becomes fully functional ; only now can babies form explicit memories of , say , how to move a mobile . In the [[HL]] second [[/HL]] half of the first year , finds Chugani , the prefrontal [[HL]] cortex [[/HL]] , the seat of forethought and logic , forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain .

Paragraph 4 : I do n't know why I did it : maybe I just feel vastly lonely , want to make my presence known , or maybe Ithought it would be funny , or maybe I was kind of applauding , the way the men in Houston must have been jumping up and down , shaking hands , mission accomplished after so many years of study and work and planning , they had done it , they had put a man onthe moon !

They turn back to the [[HL]] television [[/HL]] , the [[HL]] set [[/HL]] of their bodies so solidly against me , and I guess I do n't really understand why it would be so great \u2014 to be a man on the moon , exiled , in orbit so far from home .

You 're GO . \" With the incredible crawl - line at the bottom of the screen saying something like LIVE TRANSMISSION FROM THE MOON . Followed by long anxious moments as the landing vehicle drifted over the barren surface , moving between craters and a boulder field \u2014 I am looking at the MOON , I told myself , I am looking at the MOON \u2014 and then came the great plume of dust as touchdown approached , and then the words , the unforgettable words , \" Houston , Tranquility Base here . The Eagle has landed . \" Paragraph 2 : Naively I thought that the hatch would now open , Neil Armstrong would come scrambling down the ladder , and within moments we would behold the spectacle of a human being walking on the moon . Well , no , there was all sorts of preliminary stuff to do first , hours of it , and throughout the rest of that afternoon and evening we hovered impatiently near the TV , and waited , and waited , and waited , and somewhere around eleven o'clock came word that Armstrong was about to emerge , and there was that foot on the ladder , and the dimly seen spidery figure descending , and then , step by step , the descent to the lunar surface , the arrival on it , the utterance of the somewhat bungled and stagy official First Words . Paragraph 3 : I could hardly sleep that night . I could envision Luna City a - building a decade or two ahead , and the first lunar tourist trips , and then the first manned voyage to Mars somewhere around 1992 , with all the rest of the universe just beyond . Who could have known that the beginning of all that was also the end , that all the glory of the space adventure was front - loaded , that we would attempt the journey , and succeed , and then stop ?

{"context": "The Men of Brewster Place : Paragraph 1 : Clifford Jackson , or Abshu , as he preferred to be known in the streets , had committed himself several years ago to use his talents as a playwright to broaden the horizons for the young , gifted , and black \u2014 which was how he saw every child milling around that dark street . As head of the community center he went after every existing grant on the city and state level to bring them puppet shows with the message to avoid drugs and stay in school ; and plays in the park such as actors rapping their way through Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream . Abshu believed there was something in Shakespeare for everyone , even the young of Brewster Place , and if he broadened their horizons just a little bit , there might be enough room for some of them to slip through and see what the [[HL]] world [[/HL]] had waiting . No , it would not be a perfect [[HL]] world [[/HL]] , but definitely one with more room than they had now . Paragraph 2 : The kids who hung around the community center liked Abshu , because he never preached and it was clear that when they spoke he listened ; so he could zero in on the kid who had a real problem . It might be an offhand remark while shooting a game of pool or a one - on - one out on the basketball court , but he had a way of making them feel special with just a word or two . Paragraph 3 : Abshu wished that his [[HL]] own [[/HL]] family could have stayed together . There were four of them who ended up in foster care : him , two younger sisters , and a baby brother . He understood why his mother did what she did , but he could n't help wondering if there might have been a better way . Paragraph 4 : Abshu was put into a home that already had two other boys from foster care . The Masons lived in a small wooden bungalow right on the edge of Linden Hills . And Mother [[HL]] Mason [[/HL]] insisted that they tell anybody who asked that they actually lived in Linden Hills , a more prestigious address than Summit Place . It was a home that was kept immaculate . Paragraph 5 : But what he remembered most about the Masons was that it seemed there was never quite enough to eat . She sent them to school with a lunch of exactly one and a half sandwiches \u2014 white bread spread with margarine and sprinkled with sugar \u2014 and half an apple . Paragraph 6 : When Abshu dreamed of leaving \u2014 which was every day \u2014 he had his [[HL]] own [[/HL]] apartment with a refrigerator overflowing with food that he gorged himself with day and night . The Masons were n't mean people ; he knew he could have ended up with a lot worse . Paragraph 7 : Abshu lived with these people for nine years , won a scholarship to the local college , and moved out to support himself through school by working in a doughnut shop . By this time his mother was ready to take her children back home , but he decided that since he was already out on his [[HL]] own [[/HL]] he would stay there . One less mouth for her to worry about feeding . And after he graduated with his degree in social work , he might even be able to give her a little money to help her along . Paragraph 8 : One thing he did thank the Masons for was keeping him out of gangs . There was a strict curfew in their home that was rigidly observed . And church was mandatory . \" When you 're out on your [[HL]] own [[/HL]] , \" [[HL]] Father [[/HL]] [[HL]] Mason [[/HL]] always said , \" you can do whatever you want , but in my home you do as I say . \" No , they were n't mean people , but they were stingy \u2014 stingy with their food and with their affection .

Do whatever job makes you happy , regardless of the cost ; and fill your home with love . Well , his home became the community center right around the corner from Brewster Place and the job that made him most fulfilled was working with young kids . Paragraph 9 : The kids who hung out at the community center were n't all lost yet . They wanted to make use of the tutors for their homework ; and they wanted a safe place to hang . His motto was : Lose no child to the streets . And on occasion when that happened , he went home to cry . But he never let his emotions show at work . To the kids he was just a big , quiet kind of dude who did n't go looking for trouble , but he would n't run from it either . He was always challenged by a new set of boys who showed up at the center . He made it real clear to them that this was his territory \u2014 his [[HL]] rules [[/HL]] \u2014 and if they needed to flex their muscles , they were welcome to try . And he showed many that just because he was kind , it did n't mean he was weak . There had to be [[HL]] rules [[/HL]] some - in their [[HL]] world [[/HL]] , some kind of discipline .

Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten 's senseless ramblings that he was insane . He was judged not responsible by reason of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] and sent to a mental hospital , where he remained until his death . But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict \u2014 apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly \u2014 and called on the House of Lords to review the decision . The decision was [[HL]] upheld [[/HL]] and [[HL]] rules [[/HL]] for the [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] [[HL]] definition [[/HL]] of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] were [[HL]] put [[/HL]] into [[HL]] writing [[/HL]] . The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \" not guilty by reason of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] \" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing , or that if he did know what he was doing , he did not know it was wrong . Paragraph 3 : The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States , and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] for over a century . Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \" irresistible impulse , \" which recognizes that some mentally ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior . Paragraph 4 : During the 1970s , a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] [[HL]] definition [[/HL]] of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] proposed by the American Law Institute , which states : \" A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct , as a result of mental disease or defect , he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law . \" The word substantial suggests that \" any \" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \" total \" incapacityis not required either . The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough ; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible . Paragraph 5 : The problem of [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] responsibility in the case of mentally disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate , and a number of [[HL]] legal [[/HL]] and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] plea as a defense . The reasons for this recommendation are varied . Many experts believe that the current [[HL]] courtroom [[/HL]] procedures \u2014 in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant 's mental state \u2014 are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice . Some also argue that the abuse of the [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] plea by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction . Others claim that acquittal by reason of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] often leads to a worse punishment ( an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life ) than being convicted and sent to prison ( with the possibility of parole in a few years ) . Paragraph 6 : Despite the current controversy , actual cases of acquittal by reason of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] are quite rare . Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally responsible for their acts , and lawyers , knowing that an [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] plea is apt to fail , tend to use it only as a last resort . In California in 1980 , only 259 defendants ( outof approximately 52,000 ) were successful in pleading not guilty by reason of [[HL]] insanity [[/HL]] .", "question": "In an attempt to kill Peel , he mistakenly shot Peel 's secretary .
