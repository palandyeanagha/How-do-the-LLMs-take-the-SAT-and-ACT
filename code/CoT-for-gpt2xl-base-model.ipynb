The text indicates that although the boulders on the asteroid’s surface caused some unforeseen problems, OSIRIS-REx was able to gather a sample to return to Earth. This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu.[END]\n\n[Example 2]\n[Context]: A firefly uses specialized muscles to draw oxygen into its lower abdomen through narrow tubes, triggering a chemical reaction whereby the oxygen combines with chemicals in the firefly's abdomen to produce a glow. ____ when the firefly stops drawing in oxygen, the reaction—and the glow—cease.\n[Question]: Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?\n[Options]:\nA) For instance,\nB) By contrast,\nC) Specifically,\nD) In conclusion,\nStep-by-step reasoning:\nChoice B is the best answer. “By contrast” logically signals that the information in this sentence—that a firefly’s glow ceases when it stops drawing in oxygen contrasts with the previous sentence’s discussion of the processes that cause a firefly to begin to glow.[END]\n\n[Current Problem]\n[Context]: Painter Alma W.

The word \"distracted\" is used in the context of Thomas' interest in the colors of nature, but it is also used to describe Thomas' use of a broken brushstroke in her paintings.

The distant snowy sails, glide spirit like, Into an unknown world, to feel the sweet Enchantment of the sea thrill all the soul, Clearing the clouded brain, making the heart Leap joyous as it own bright, singing waves!\n[Question]: Which choice best describes the function of the portion, “Ever repulsed, yet ever rushing on—Filled with a life that will not know defeat;” in the text as a whole?\n[Options]:\nA) It portrays the surroundings as an imposing and intimidating scene.\nB) It characterizes the sea’s waves as a relentless and enduring force.\nC) It conveys the speaker’s ambivalence about the natural world.\nD) It draws a contrast between the sea’s waves and the speaker’s thoughts.\nStep-by-step reasoning:\nOption A is the most accurate choice because it conveys how the text functions in a larger context. The text describes the speaker as a person who is both repulsive and irresistible. The speaker is repulsive because of his or her repulsive appearance, but the speaker is also irresistible because he or she is so irresistible.\n\nOption B is the second-best answer, because it best describes how this portion functions within the larger context of the poem. The poem describes a scene in which the speaker and the reader are both repelled and irresistibly drawn to the speaker. The reader is repelled because of the speaker's repulsiveness, but also because the reader wants to know more about the speaker, to learn more about him or her.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":34},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract generated reasoning for evaluation\ngenerated_cot = response.split(\"Step-by-step reasoning:\")[-1].split(\"[END]\")[0].strip()\nreference_cot = ('''Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole.

The law says that people with disabilities must be able to get into and out of all public buildings. It also says that business must offer special services to people who have special needs. Companies can not refuse to hire disabled workers. Many businesses may have to change their buildings and services. --Ramps must be built so people can get into buildings. --Movie theatres must have space for people in wheelchairs and seats for their friends to sit near them. --Elevators must have floor number in  _ . This law will help millions of people. One woman who has been in a wheelchair for many years said, \"It is like a dream.\"\n[Question]: Ramps can help people_.\n[Options]:\nA) with hearing problems\nB) who have difficulty in using their hands\nC) who have difficulty in using their legs or feet\nD) who don't like stairs\nStep-by-step reasoning:\nChoice C is the correct answer because it accurately identifies who ramps help, as described in the passage. The passage states, “Ramps must be built so people can get into buildings,” in the context of a law ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities, particularly those using wheelchairs. Ramps specifically aid individuals with difficulty using their legs or feet, such as wheelchair users, by providing an alternative to stairs, making Choice C the best fit.\n\n[Current Problem]\n[Context]: One day a student went to see his teacher. He had been given an important position and now was coming to say goodbye to his teacher. The old man asked him how he would live among high officials. The student answered, \" I will be all right. I have prepared a hundred high hats, one for each official I will meet. I am sure I will succeed.\" The teacher got angry on hearing this.  \"What?\" he cried. \"Is this what ten years of my teaching has made of you? Nothing but flatterer ?\" \"Excuse me, honored  master,\" the student  rose to his feet and apologized hurriedly. \"But you have always been absorbed in  your studies and don't know how vulgar  the world has come to be. There are few men in the world who are above flatterers like you.\" \"There is something true in what you said,\" the teacher nodded, smiling with one of the student's \"high hats\" on.\n[Question]: The teacher  _  .\n[Options]:\nA) liked to be flattered as well\nB) really knew nothing about the vulgar world\nC) was in need of a high hat\nD) was satisfied with the new hat\nStep-by-step reasoning:\nThe passage states that the teacher was flattered by the student. The teacher liked the fact that the student had prepared a hat for each of the high officials he would meet. He was satisfied that the hat would help him in his new position.\nStep B is the best choice because it describes the teacher as a person who really knows nothing about vulgarity. He did not know that the world had become so vulgar. He also did not realize that there were few men who were above flatters like him.\nThe teacher was not flattered because he was not aware of the vulgarity of the world. He could not have been flattered if he had been aware of it.\nC is the worst choice because the passage describes the student as\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":64},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract generated reasoning for evaluation\ngenerated_cot = response.split(\"Step-by-step reasoning:\")[-1].split(\"[END]\")[0].strip()\nreference_cot = ('''Choice A is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the teacher’s reaction, as described in the passage. The passage shows the teacher initially angry at the student’s plan to flatter officials with “high hats,” but when the student flatters him by suggesting he is above flattery, the teacher smiles and nods, “with one of the student’s ‘high hats’ on,” indicating he enjoys the flattery. Choice A, “liked to be flattered as well,” aligns with this, showing the teacher’s acceptance of the student’s flattery despite his initial objection.''')\n\n# Evaluate response\nprint(\"\\nEVALUATION METRICS:\")\nmetrics = evaluate_response(generated_cot, reference_cot)\nfor metric, value in metrics.items():\n    print(f\"{metric}: {value:.3f}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-01T19:48:28.360476Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-01T19:48:28.360732Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-01T19:48:28.739051Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-01T19:48:28.360705Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-01T19:48:28.738543Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nEVALUATION METRICS:\nBERTScore_F1: 0.588\nROUGE-1_F1: 0.434\nROUGE-2_F1: 0.116\nROUGE-L_F1: 0.204\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":65},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
