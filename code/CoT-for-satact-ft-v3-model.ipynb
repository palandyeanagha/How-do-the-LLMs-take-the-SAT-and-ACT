John Winthrop, a professor at Harvard College, felt the quake and awoke. \"I rose\", Winthrop wrote, \"and lighted a candle, looked at my watch, and found it to be 15minutes after four.\" John Winthrop hurried downstairs to the grandfather clock. It had stopped three minutes before, at 4:12. Except for stopping the clock, the quake had only thrown a key from the mantel  to the floor. The clock had stopped because Winthrop had put some long glass tubes he was using for an experiment into the case for safekeeping. The quake had knocked the tubes over and blocked the pendulum .Winthrop, therefore, had the key on the floor.

The sequence of sequences is a cause, and the ad touts the sequence as part of the description of the job opening. The ad then links the sequence to the larger sequence, which in turn links it to the ad's claim that the sequence causes the ad to mention the sequence in the ad.

The passage mentions Mrs. Allen, her son, and her daughter (three people), and Laura Barnes, who is a widow but has no children or other family members explicitly noted (one person).

It is easy to see our children among other children because they are all wearing the same clothes. And now we have ten, we dress them like this because we don't want to take other children home by mistake. When there are other children among ours, it is easy to see them because their clothes are different.\n[Question]: How many people does Mr. Brown see in the street one day?
