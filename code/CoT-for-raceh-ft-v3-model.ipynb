He moved from Kentucky to Indiana when I was seven. We reached our new home about the time the state came into the Union.

There were some so-called schools, but what was required of a teacher never went beyond \"reading, writing, and adding.\" If a stranger supposed to understand Latin happened to live for a time in the area, he was looked on as wizard  . There was simply nothing to excite a desire for education. Of course, when I grew up, I did not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and add, but that was all.
